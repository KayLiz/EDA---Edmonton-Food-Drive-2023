# EDA---Edmonton-Food-Drive-2023
---

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** of the 2023 Edmonton Food Drive dataset. The yearly food drive is organized by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, aiming to collect and distribute donations across Edmonton's wards and stakes. Through detailed EDA, this project uncovers patterns and insights to support operational planning, donation volume prediction, and route optimization for future food drives.  

This analysis lays the foundation for building machine learning models to predict donation outcomes and improve efficiency.

## 🎯 Objectives  
1. **Explore Historical Donation Trends**:  
   - Analyze ward and stake-level donation patterns across regions.  
2. **Identify Key Factors Impacting Donation Success**:  
   - Investigate relationships between population density, bag volumes, and route completion times.  
3. **Support Predictive Modeling Efforts**:  
   - Provide actionable insights to guide model development for donation prediction and route optimization.

## 🛠️ Features  
- **Comprehensive Data Visualizations**:  
  Visualizes donation trends, population distributions, and volunteer route metrics.  
- **Data Quality Analysis**:  
  Identifies missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the dataset.  
- **Stake and Ward Analysis**:  
  Evaluates performance and trends across Edmonton’s regions.

## 🚀 Exploratory Data Analysis Steps  
1. **Data Cleaning**:  
   - Address missing values, handle outliers, and ensure data consistency.  
2. **Feature Understanding**:  
   - Analyze distributions of key variables like donation bag counts and route completion times.  
3. **Visualization**:  
   - Generate insights using bar charts, box plots, heatmaps, and line graphs.  
4. **Correlation Analysis**:  
   - Investigate relationships between demographic factors and donation outcomes.  
5. **Ward-Level Analysis**:  
   - Identify high-performing wards and analyze potential factors behind their success.

## 📈 Insights & Findings  
- **Donation Volume Trends**:  
  - Ward-level donations show a positive correlation with population density.  
- **Volunteer Route Performance**:  
  - Longer routes tend to have higher completion times but don’t always correlate with donation volume.  
- **Outliers in Bag Collection**:  
  - Some stakes significantly outperform others due to unique demographic or organizational factors.
